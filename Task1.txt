Q1: What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?
In my opinion,AI-Driven Development means learning and building software with the help of 
powerful AI tools instead of doing everything manually.It feels like having an intelligent 
partner who can write code,fix bugs,explain errors and help me learn faster.
As a student, AIDD removes fear and confusion.I don not get stuck for hours on small 
issues anymore.AI guides me,suggests solutions and lets me focus on understanding concepts 
not memorizing syntax.
It also gives me confidence that even if I am still learning.
I can create real projects,apps and tools that used to take professionals years to build. 
For me,AIDD is a new way of learning,thinking and building where AI helps me grow instead of 
replacing me.

Q2: How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?
I think the future will be a strong partnership between humans and AI. 
AI will do the heavy technical work writing code fast,generating features and testing 
software while humans will focus on clear thinking,planning,creativity and decision making.
In the future developers will not be just “coders.” They will become AI collaborators 
who guide agents,check outputs,give instructions and design smart solutions. Even students 
like me will be able to build professional level applications with the help of AI agents.
AI will bring speed but humans will bring judgment and understanding. 
Together both will produce better,cleaner and smarter software.
So for me,the future is not humans vs AI but humans + AI working as one team.
